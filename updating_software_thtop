##Â How Julia is setup

Julia versions are installed in `/opt/julia/julia-1.X.Y`. 

Those versions are not in the path, so normally they are not executable.

They can be broght in the path by typing `module load julia` or `module load julia/1.X/Y`. Those module files are located at `/usr/local/Modules/julia/1.X/1.X.Y`

To install new versions of julia an user with sudo power should
 - download the 64 bit linux pacakge
 - unzip it 
 - move the resulting folder `julia-1.X.Y` to `/opt/julia/`
 - create a new module file at /usr/local/Modules/julia/1.X/1.X.Y` by copying any other module file for an older version and editing the version.
 - then to generate the ijulia kernel for jupyter you should run the following command as root
 ```
 sudo su
 cd $HOME
 ./julia_update
 ```
 the julia_update program *MUST* be executed as root otherwise permission iossues will arise.
